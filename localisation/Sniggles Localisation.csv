BM_HUNGARY;* Hungary-Croatia;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_HUNGARY_DESC;The death of Ilyena Arpad, the childless Queen of Croatia, passes her Kingdom on to her brother Laszlo, King of Hungary. The union of Hungary-Croatia brings strength to the Magyars, but will Laszlo and this new-formed Balkan union be able to stand the test of time? Elsewhere in the world, Yusuf Almoravid, Sultan of Mauretania, has begun uniting the peoples of North Africa and southern Iberia. He seeks to contest--and if possible, reverse--the conquests that the kingdom of Leon-Castille has managed against the Muslims of Iberia.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
BM_THE_ISLES;* King of Dublin and the Isles;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_THE_ISLES_DESC;Godred Crovan, of both Norwegian and Irish descent, has finally succeeded in expanding his Kingdom of Mann and the Isles to include his birthright, the Kingdom of Dublin. The day of the Norwegian conquerors is over, dead with the failure of Harald Hårdråde at Stamford Bridge, but Godred Crovan believes in turning back that clock. From his foothold in Dublin, he seeks to expand and name himself Ard Ri Eirinn, High King of Ireland. But Gudrod is not without other troubles. He holds lands that Malcolm Dunkeld calls his own, and the Scottish king will not back down from his own birthright easily.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
BM_NORWAY_1;* The Collapse of the Isles;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_NORWAY_1_DESC;The Kingdom that Godred Crovan worked his entire life to create is no more. He is dead of the plague and his kingdom has fractured. While King Magnus III of Norway has reasserted hegemony over much of Godred's old land, Galloway and Dublin have both declared independence from the Norwegian King. The north of Albion lies in flux: will Magnus be able to avenge his defeated grandfather the Hårdråde and terrorise the shores of Albion once again, or will Edgar, the young King of Scotland, be able to use this transition to his advantage?;;;;;;;;;x, ,,,,,,,,
BM_EDGE_OF_KNIFE;* The Edge of the Knife;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_EDGE_OF_KNIFE_DESC;The Western World stands upon the edge of a knife. In Iberia, the Almoravid Sultanate is nearing total victory, with Alfonso of León-Castilla barely holding on to the north of España, and the Kingdom of Aragón-Navarra and the Duchy of Barcelona barely surviving at the French border. Across the Mediterranean, although the Komnenoi have taken the throne and fight valiantly against the Turk, Sultan Kilij Arslan holds much of Anatolia under his grasp, and looks with greedy eyes toward the independent Duchy of Armenia Minor. Iberia or Anatolia, Castille or Byzantium: will the heathens succeed in breaking the iron walls of Christianity to finally breech the interior of Europe?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
BM_ANTIOCH;* The First Crusade;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ANTIOCH_DESC;The Levant reels in the aftermath of the bloody conflict that is the First Crusade. In the north, the Principalities of Antioch and Edessa vie for superiority, both against the Muslims and each other. The Prince of Antioch, Bohemond, is in constant contention with Thoros, the Orthodox Duke of Armenia Minor, whose lands he has usurped. To the south, the infant Kingdom of Jerusalem is balanced against the weakened Fatimid Caliphate, the large Emirate of Damascus, and myriad minor sheikhs dividing it from the Princes to the north. Can the Catholics hold out long enough to unify, or must another Crusade be called to secure a Catholic Holy Land?;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_JERUSALEM;* Jerusalem at its Height;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_JERUSALEM_DESC;The crown of the kingdom of Jerusalem was given to the son-in-law of the dead king Fulk of the Anjou dynasty and at the same time he is the de facto ruler of the principality of Antioch. However, Fulk, who may have reached the zenith of his kingdom, does not receive full support in the kingdom. His sister-in-law Alice of Antioch is trying to regain the crown of Antioch. Count Ponce of Tripoli and Joselin II of Edessa are ready to help her. But Joselin himself is in danger. A great Seljuk warlord, Imad al-Din Zengi, has established himself in Aleppo, planning to conquer Damascus and then Edessa. In the north, Armenia Minor was ruled by Levon I, who took advantage of the death of the former Prince of Antioch to regain some Armenian lands. However, now a threat hangs over Armenia Minor: Byzantine Emperor John II Komnenos intends to return the former territories of his empire, first of all Minor Armenia and Antioch. Who would emerge victorious from this difficult situation?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_KOMNENOS;* Manuel Komnenos;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_KOMNENOS_DESC;Manuel Komnenos reigns in Byzantium, and Hungary looks on in fear. Ever the opportunist, Manuel had long ago concluded a pact with the King of Hungary, István III,whereby István's brother Belá would be educated at the Imperial court in Constantinople. Manuel had as-of-yet been without legitimate male issue, and intended Belá to be married to his daughter Maria, to eventually rule alongside her as Emperor.  Sensing opportunity, however, Manuel decided to move against István and press his son-in-law's claims on the duchies of Dalmatia and Croatia. With those titles secured, Belá is now a landed vassal of Manuel, and the heir to the Kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary. Although the Komnenos line looks as though it may slip from the Imperial seat unless Manuel takes immediate action, the Byzantine Empire stands to grasp the greatest prize it has had in its sights since the Komnenoi took the throne: the buffer between the Holy Roman and Eastern Roman Empires.;;;;;;;;;x,,
BM_SERBIA;* Fall of the Komnenos;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SERBIA_DESC;The Komnenos have fallen from the Imperial Throne, and Byzantium is falling with them. The newly-formed Kingdoms of Serbia and Bulgaria have declared their independence from the Byzantine crown, the Seljuk Sultans of Rum press against the Empire's restored borders in Anatolia, and an independent Belá III rules in Hungary-Croatia. All of Manuel Komnenos's dreams have come to naught, but this is a time of opportunity, for those wise enough to see it. Alexios Komnenos, an infant member of the royal Komnenos dynasty, rules in Trebizond. If he can gather support enough to press his claim on Byzantium, the young Komnenos can work to restore the golden age his family's untimely fall from grace brought to a close.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
BM_IBERIA;* The Iberian Campaign;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_IBERIA_DESC;Iberia is balanced between the Muslims and Christians. In the north the Catholics divide the land between five Kingdoms: Portugal, León, Castille, Navarra, and Aragón. To the south, the Muslims are unified under the powerful Almohad Sultanate. Is this a time of opportunity and growth for the Christians, or has the Almohad Sultan amassed enough power to finally breach Europe proper?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
BM_FRACTURE;* The Fall of Rum;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_FRACTURE_DESC;Plagued by the Mongols to the east and decadence within itself, the Sultanate of Rum has collapsed. In its place a half-dozen Sultans have risen, all claiming to be Rum's true successor. The Byzantine Empire, labored and barely standing, has recovered Constantinople, but its strength to do more than that is in question. Many other lords and lands have interest in the east, not to mention Naples and the still-warring Dukes in Greece, but regardless of if it is desired, this is one man's time. A great nation must rise from the ashes of Rum--or Byzantium--and whoever succeeds in unifying the disparate peoples of the Aegean shall have power enough to challenge the gateguard of Europe, Hungary.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
BM_SWEDEN;* Magnus IV;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SWEDEN_DESC;Magnus IV, by election King of Sweden and by birthright King of Norway, has temporarily united much of Scandinavia under his rule. Unless Magnus proves to be an exceptional King it is unlikely that the union will live beyond him, but there are those who whisper of an Empire of the North, with Magnus I at its head….;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
BM_ITALY;* The Italian Campaign;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ITALY_DESC;The Holy Roman Empire is in decline, and Italy has finally been completely freed from its grasp. Dukes war with counts, mayors with Doges. Who will unite Italy--or will Italy be united at all?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SALADIN;* Salah ad-Din;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SALADIN_DESC;Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub--better known to the Western world as Saladin--has taken the throne of Egypt for his own. Previously the servant of the Emir of Damascus, Nur ad-Din, Salah ad-Din has broken with his former benefactor to usurp the Sultanate of Egypt from the Shia Fatimids during a period of crisis, choosing opportunity over longstanding friendship with the Emir, and causing great tension in the Crusader States. Although Salah ad-Din is likely to be preoccupied for a time with the Emir of Aleppo, not to mention his own Shia subjects, it is only a matter of time until the holy warrior turns his eyes toward the states of Jerusalem and Antioch….;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
BM_ANARCHY;* The Anarchy;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ANARCHY_DESC;The Anarchy was a period of early English history in which the dynasty of the Norman conqueror William broke down and was replaced by the cadet house of Plantagenet. It began when the second Norman King of England, Henry I, died without legitimate issue. Although Henry attempted to place his daughter Matilda on the throne, the lords of England would not have it and declared king a male descendent of William through the female line, Stephen de Blois. Support for Stephen was not absolute: Matilda is supported principally by her husband, the son of King Foulque of Jerusalem, Geoffrey of Anjou, who conquered Normandy on his wife's behalf. Matilda is also sided by her brother, Robert II, Earl of Gwent. However, Stephen also boasts powerful allies – Count Thibault II of Champagne, the king's brother, and William of Ypres, Stephen's close associate, are ready to ensure the victory of de Blois dynasty.;;;;;;;;;x,,
BM_HABSBURG;* The Habsburgs;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_HABSBURG_DESC;Rudolf von Habsburg has put down Ottokar of Bohemia, his only rival for the Imperial throne. With Ottokar's defeat much of his lands have defaulted back to the crown, including the duchy of Österreich, which Rudolf has entrusted to his son, Albricht. Although the succession is secure, not all is well. Charles d'Anjou, a relative of the French monarch and a claimaint to the kingdom of Sicily, has recently managed to press his claim against that selfsame kingdom. His own lands in Provence have been joined to his Sicilian crown, and the powerful monarch has even begun expanding toward Greece, further cementing his hold on the south of the peninsula. Many Italian states are eager to take advantage of the same weakness which Charles sensed, and have begun to slowly distance themselves from the Empire during these tumultuous times. The victory of the House of Habsburg must not be in vain--stop the Italian collapse, in the name of the Empire!;;;;;;;;;x,,
BM_PLANTAGENET;* Holy Roman Empire in Turmoil;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_PLANTAGENET_DESC;Richard Plantagenet, through bribes to the German electorate, has been elected as King of the Germans. His election is not a simple one, however. It raises serious questions about the future of the Holy Roman Empire. The powerful Plantagenet England is a strong ally of the Emperor--one that he may need, for the Holy Roman Empire is dangerously imbalanced. Konrad II von Hohenstaufen, King of Sicily and great-grandson of Frederick Barbarossa, is an independent elector of the Empire, and jealously seeks a return of his family's titles. His control of the Duchy of Swabia means the Kingdom of Sicily has lands in central Germany, weakening the Empire and making Konrad a valid successor. If danger from outside Kings is not enough, Ottokar II of Bohemia has expanded toward the Adriatic sea, massing power and support for his own potential election. Can the House of Plantagenet maintain control through another election?;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_CASTILLE;* 'Imperator Totius Hispaniae';;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_CASTILLE_DESC;After the tragic death of Sancho II the Strong, his brother Alfonso VI the Brave, received all his father's crowns of Castille, Leon and Galicia, which the father had distributed to his sons and which Sancho had harshly taken from his brothers. Now, with his vast domain, Alfonso may decide whether to do as his father did and distribute the crowns to his descendants, or try to keep them in the hands of one of them. Alfonso is ambitious: he is already prepared to become ‘imperator totius Hispaniae’ (Emperor of all Spain), as his father was, and to expand the lands of the Spanish crowns. The Muslims of Iberia are frightened and call upon the Amir of the Almoravids for help. After conquering all of Maghreb, he is not averse to intervene in the South Spain to extend his power there as well. But he must choose a priority, for to the south of his domain the rebellious ruler of Ghana does not wish to accept Islam. Where will Amir Yusuf ibn Tashfin go? Will Ghana's infidels resist?;;;;;;;;;x,, ,,,,,,,,
BM_ALMORAVID;* Islam in Retreat;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ALMORAVID_DESC;The ascension of a young boy to the throne of the Almoravid Sultanate in the west has caused a domino effect of rebellions in its Iberian territories, while the Seljuk Sultanate's decadent collapse, accelerated by the Kingdom of Jerusalem battering at its borders, weakens Islam's unity in the east. Now is the time, servants of Christendom, to take up joyous arms in the name of Christ!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_SELJUK;* The Collapse of the Seljuks;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SELJUK_DESC;The Seljuk Sultanate, beset on all sides with enemies and divided internally by decadence, corruption, and incompetence, has finally collapsed. Myriad ex-vassals, remaining members of the Seljuk family, and opportunists stand poised to fight over the remnants. The Sunni Caliph, the Turkish Sultan of Khiva, and untold Emirs, some of them the last remnants of the old Persian elite, all circle the corpse with hunger--who will win the great prize?;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_VEXIN;* Richard vs. Philippe;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_VEXIN_DESC;King Richard 'the Lionheart' of England and King Philippe 'the Augustus' of France had a final falling out. Having abandoned the Third Crusade, Philippe has decided to deprive Richard of his possessions in France. Prince John, who also wants these possessions, is ready to join him. In addition, Philippe has unobvious allies: in Brittany rules Constance, whose lands Richard intended to transfer to his heir, Constance's son Arthur. What happens if Constance refuses it and calls on her uncle, King William 'the Lion' of Scotland, who claims English possessions in Northumbria? And in Wales, Rhys ap Gruffydd, proudly calling himself 'Prince of the Welsh', is gaining power. The descendants of the King of Wales could impede him, but they’re mired in internecine strife. However, everything isn’t quiet in France: only 10 years ago, Philippe defeated a broad anti-royal coalition, which could now be led by Count Henry II of Champagne, also King of Jerusalem ...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
BM_ANUSHTIGINID;* The Seljuk Successors;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_ANUSHTIGINID_DESC;The Anushtiginid Sultanate has finally restored a degree of order to Persia by defeating the house of Ghurid and exiling the upstart state of Rajastan to the Indian subcontinent, finally cementing their claim on Persia and uniting the country in as stable a political union as has been seen since the collapse of the Seljuks over 50 years before. In spite of great success, maintaining their hold might not be as easy for house Anushtiginid as it was to gain it. Discontented vassals, the furious exile-Shahdom of Rajastan, and curious rumors of riders to the east are enough to keep any wise Sultan awake through the long nights.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
BM_NAPLES;* The Sicilian Vespers;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_NAPLES_DESC;Three years ago, the Sicilian Vespers happened and led to a bloody war. The Sicilians, rebelling against the tyranny of French ruler Charles I of Anjou, asked for intercession from King Pedro III the Great of Aragon. As a result, Southern Italy was divided. On the island of Sicily, Jaime II the Just, second son of the dead Aragonese intercessor king, established power, while on the Italic Peninsula the crown of Sicily is held by Charles II the Lame, son of Charles I. Both sides of the conflict have powerful allies: Jaime II is defended by the kings of Aragon and Castile, and the king of Naples is supported by the king of Hungary and Croatia. In short, a new war will not be easy. Moreover, French King Philip IV the Fair inherited the kingdom of Navarre and he is also a force to be reckoned with in the fight in the Pyrenees. Who and when will take action and against whom?;;;;;;;;;x
BM_POLAND;* The Polish-Bohemian Union;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_POLAND_DESC;Due to the untimely death of the Polish monarch without a favorable heir, Vaclav II Premyslid of Bohemia has been crowned king in place of another Piast. This gives Vaclav--heir to Ottokar, and all the desire for revenge against the Hohenstaufens that comes with being his son--a great deal of power in Europe. If Vaclav is given time to consolidate and expand it is unlikely the Holy Roman Empire will ever be able to reassert its authority over Bohemia, with its control of the Italian peninsula already crumbling. The time to move is now!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
BM_GH;* The Golden Horde Converts!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_GH_DESC;The Khan of the Golden Horde has converted to Sunni Islam!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_MONGOL_SPLIT;* Sons of Genghis Khan;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_MONGOL_SPLIT_DESC;Following the death of the great Genghis Khan, his realm has split between his heirs. His grandson Batu rules the Golden Horde in the north, his youngest son Tolui rules the Ilkhanate in the south, his eldest surviving son Chagatai rules an eponymous Khanate between the two, and his middle son Ogodei has been left the land of Mongolia itself. Although the division of these realms may well make the Mongol menace weaker on the offensive, their dynastic alliance will certainly make what lands they have already claimed nigh-impenetrable. Unless, of course, one of the Khans turns on the others in a quest to recreate the empire of his forebear…;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
BM_PERSIAN_STRUGGLE;* The Struggle for Persia;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_PERSIAN_STRUGGLE_DESC;The Persian Plateau is divided. On one part the Anushteginids established their rule. The new ruler, Ala al-Din Tekish, is very ambitious: with the help of the Qara Khitai he has dethroned his younger brother Sultan Shah and is preparing for new conquests. One of targets is Iraqi Sultan Arslan Shah, grandnephew of last Seljuk Sultan Ahmad Sanjar. The Gurids rule on other part. Ghiyath al-Din, together with his brother and loyal ally Mu'izz al-Din, occupy possession after possession belonging to Khusrau Malik, ruler of the Ghaznevid Empire. However, the Anushteginids and the Gurids would be locked in a battle for control of the Plateau. Who will prevail? Will the descendant of the Seljuks be able to restore their greatness? And will Khusrau Malik become the last ruler of the Ghaznevid Empire? But the Qara Khitai shouldn’t be ignored – their ruler Yelu Pusuwan, known for her viciousness, may announce a new ruinous campaign to Khwarazm...;;;;;;;;;x,,
BM_INDIAN_AMBITION;* al-Hind Ambition ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_INDIAN_AMBITION_DESC;Alauddin Muhammad Shah is a truly great ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. With the support of his loyal generals, he has repelled the Mongol invasions and now he is preparing to penetrate deep into al-Hind (Persian & Arabic name for India): first he wants to protect the trade routes to Gujarat and capture Pamara and Solanki (Vaghela), and then he will descend to the Deccan plateau, conquering Hoysala to plunder the neighbouring kingdoms. In the South Indian campaign, he may be invaluably assisted by his slave-general Malik Kafur. Will Muhammad Shah realise his plans? And in Bengal, a breakaway fragment of the Delhi Sultanate, Shamsuddin Furiz Shah, whose independence is recognised by Muhammad Shah himself, has come to power. On his coins, Furiz Shah already refers to himself as the 'Kharaj of Bang', but East Bengal is still in the hands of the descendants of the ancient Indian Deva dynasty. Is it time for Furiz Shah to become the full ruler of Bengal?;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_RUM;* The Seljuks at its Height ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_RUM_DESC;Under Malik Shah I, the Seljuk Empire reached its peak: it controlled Persia and the Levant, fought with the Karakhanids over Turkestan, and clashed with the Ghaznavids in Khorasan, leading to a dynastic alliance. Unlike the latter, with the Fatimids there’s a bone of contention – the Levant, controlled by the Ismailis before. Would their neighbourhood be fatal? However, the first female Muslim ruler, Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi of Yemen, who became the second after the Ismaili Caliph, could aid the Fatimids. And in Anatolia Malik Shah's relative Suleiman Shah I, who had fought with Malik's father, founded his own state – the Sultanate of Rum. The domination of the Turks in Asia Minor provoked a crisis in Byzantium: illustrious general Nikephoros Botaneiates decided to launch the struggle for the crown in order to give an adequate answer to the Turks. Ruling emperor Michael VII Doukas wasn’t averse to using the Seljuks to suppress the rebellious vassal...;;;;;;;;;"x"",,,,,,,,,,,"
BM_TEMUJIN;* Temujin Borjigin;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_TEMUJIN_DESC;Temujin Borjigin has united the Mongolian tribes into a great Khanate, the largest and strongest that the region has ever seen. He was proclaimed the ruler of the Mongols – Genghis Khan. Although now Temujin is preparing a campaign to the east, to China, his neighbours in the west should tremble: he has set himself the goal of subjugating the whole world. Before it is too late, the future slaves of the Mongol empire must prepare for the decisive battle. However, the Uighurs of Qocho would greet the Mongols as liberators rather than conquerors... Ride forth, Genghis Khan! Tremble his slaves!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_LIUBECH;* The Council of Liubech ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_LIUBECH_DESC;The councils of Rus’ princes in Liubech and Uvetichi were held securing their domains, and it seems to put an end to the internecine strife for a while. But for how long? Power of Prince Vladimir Monomakh of Pereyaslavl, the founder of powerful branch in Rurikid's house – Monomakh – already begin to rise: he and his sons control the most part of Rus’. However, their main opponents – Iziaslavichi-Turovsky – in the person of Sviatopolk Iziaslavich possess the capital of Kiev. Which of the two branches will prevail? Or possibly the game will be changed by Prince Oleg Sviatoslavich of Novgorod-Severskiy, who claimed to take over his father's Chernigov? We shouldn't write off the descendants of Rogvolod and Rogneda – Rogvolodovichi, who are represented by Prince Vseslav Bryacheslavich of Polotsk, who one ruled Rus’ and could try again.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_CARPATHIANS;* Beyond the Carpathians ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_CARPATHIANS_DESC;Legendary Batu Khan died. Sartaq Khan, his eldest son, a Christian, became a new Khan. Can he keep power in an environment of pagans and win favour of Orthodox vassals? And Rus’ princes do not doze off. Prince Daniel of Galicia, proclaimed King of Rus', again gathers forces to throw off the Tatar-Mongol yoke. However, Prince Alexander Nevsky disagrees, believing that Russia has not yet become strong enough to repulse the Tatars. Beyond the Carpathians in Hungary rules King Bela IV, ‘the second founder’, as he is nicknamed by the people. He patronises his son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich. Rostislav, who lost the struggle for Galicia, has not lost his pretensions, but now he is ready to engage in a new adventure: in Bulgaria rules King Michael II Asen, who is about to be killed by his cousin Kaliman. Can Rostislav take advantage of Michael's marriage to his daughter, who may soon be widowed, to take Tarnovo?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_BERKE_KHAN;* Berke Khan the Muslim ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_BERKE_KHAN_DESC;Berke Khan, the brother of Batu Khan and the first Muslim Khan, came to power in the Golden Horde. Although he positions himself as a true proponent of Islam, there are suspicions that he uses the religion for his own selfish purposes. For the South Caucasus, he had unleashed a struggle with Ilkhan Hulagu, who had managed to execute the Caliph of Baghdad. Berke Khan allied with Mamluk Sultan Baybars in order to wage jihad against the infidel Ilkhan of Persia. Baybars himself set his sights on fighting the Crusader states in the Levant. He opposes Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan, who is in the game – the ruler of Jerusalem, whose parents have claims on neighbouring Christian states... In the Balkans, Rum Sultan Kilij Arslan IV is seeking allies to avenge the Greeks for the abduction of his brother, and in Nicaea unknown Michael Palaeologus is preparing to overthrow juvenile emperor John IV. The king of Bulgaria is also prepared to take advantage of the emperor's minority to regain lost Thrace...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_HEIRS;* Heirs ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_HEIRS_DESC;The bookmark is dedicated to the heirs of the main characters in the script 'Beyond the Carpathians'. The land of Galicia-Volhynia is ruled by Prince Leo, the eldest son of Rus' first king, Daniel of Galicia. Will he fulfil his father's mission? Leo's brother Shvarn Danilovich became the first Rurikid who ruled Lithuania. Perhaps, ruling a principality independent of the Horde, he would able to liberate Rus' land. But the Lithuanian ruling family is not extinct: Daumantas, son of Mindaugas, reigns in Pskov. Will he make Pskov independent of Novgorod, or will he go further and reclaim Lithuania, or even free all of Rus'? And to the south, on the banks of the Danube, Michael Rostislavich, son of Rostislav Mikhailovich, reigns. Could he achieve his father's glory? Further south, Charles of Anjou, the younger brother of the King of France, holds Naples. Charles had seized the crown of Sicily and now, having tied with the last Latin emperor, he planned to rebuild the empire.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_HUNGARY_1;* Hungarian Crown ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_HUNGARY_1_DESC;It has been a year since the glorious King of Hungary, Bela IV, ‘the second founder’, so nicknamed by the people because under him Hungary was able to recover from the Mongol invasion, died. Contrary to Bela's will, who stipulated that the throne should go to his beloved daughter Anna and his grandson-in-law King Ottokar II of Bohemia, Bela's eldest son Stephen V, with whom the old king waged endless wars, inherited the crown. But how long would Stephen's reign last? Could he eclipse Bela IV, or would he soon fall, leaving the crown to his young son Ladislaus? And if so, can Bela's beloved grandson Bela Rostislavich take the Hungarian throne or will he fall at the hands of Stephen's and Ladislaus' supporters? And what role will the powerful neighbour Ottokar II play in Hungarian history?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_SUNDIATA_KEITA;* The Epic of Sundiata ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SUNDIATA_KEITA_DESC;Soumaoro Kante, son of Diara Kante, who defeated the Ghana Empire, conquered the Mandinka tribes and defeated one of the oldest clans, the Keita clan. On the command of the elders, the messengers set out in search of the exiled Sologon and her son Manding Diara (Sundiata Keita). He is to lead the struggle of the Mandinka people against the invader Soumaoro. In this struggle he must be assisted by the 'King of Ghana' Soumaba Cisse, possibly a distant relative of one of the former dynasties ruling Ghana. Will the Muslim Sundiata, a descendant of one of the ascetics of the Prophet Mohammed, or the pagan faithful Soumaoro, win? Or would the descendant of the kings of Ghana prevail? The battle of Kirina is at hand...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_BATU;* Mongol Invasion of Europe ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_BATU_DESC;At the Kurultai, the ruler of the Mongol Empire, Ogedei Khan, under pressure from Jochi Khan’s descendants who supported him on the throne, announced a campaign against the unconquered peoples of the West. The campaign is led by Batu Khan, son of Jochi. In this campaign Mongols will pass Volga Bulgaria, all Rus' territory, the Kipchak steppe, wreaking havoc and spilling rivers of blood. They will invade Poland, the eastern fringes of the Holy Roman Empire, Hungary and Bulgaria. Lead the conquering armies, engraving the name of Batu Khan, the 'Good Khan', into the annals of history, or side with the doomed to conquer. Unite Rus' around one of the branches of the Rurikid House and achieve victory on the Sit River. Alternatively, win the glory of taming infidels, as European rulers have been able to do. Perhaps by lurking in the dense Lithuanian forests you can prepare a more appropriate response to the invading Mongols? The choice is yours!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_BULGARIA;* Herdsman King of Bulgaria ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_BULGARIA_DESC;An ordinary herdsman, Ivaylo the Bardokva (Lettuce), became king of Bulgaria! Observing the suffering of his people from the Mongol raids and the helplessness of the Bulgarian nobility, and guided by his visions of greatness to come, Ivaylo led a peasant uprising which in a decisive battle defeated the royal armies, and King Constantine I Tih was killed by the rebels. Ivaylo triumphantly entered the capital and was crowned king of Bulgaria. Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene, the widow of the deceased, became his wife. Such extraordinary conditions have decided to take advantage Byzantium emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus at whom Ivan Asen, the grandson of Tsar Ivan II Asen has found a refuge. Michael VIII Palaiologos sealed his alliance with Ivan by marrying his daughter Irina to him. Now all that remained was to attract to his side an ally - Beylerbey of the Golden Horde Nogai Khan, who had his own plans for the Balkans...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_BYZANTIAN_RUINS;* Byzantian Ruins ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_BYZANTIAN_RUINS_DESC;More than two years ago, the Fourth Crusade turned the Byzantine Empire into ruins, and many states sprang up. Henry I of Flanders, the second Latin Emperor, waged war with his orthodox neighbours, fighting for the survival of the Catholic state. On the west coast of Asia Minor, Theodore I Laskaris, son-in-law of Alexios III Angelos, proclaimed himself a new emperor of Byzantium. In Epirus Michael I Komnenos Doukas, cousin of Isaac II Angelus and Alexius III Angelus, has all rights to the Byzantine crown. In Trebizond the last of the Komnenos, Alexios I Megas Komnenos, grandson of Andronikos I Komnenos and nephew of the Georgian Queen Tamar, could use his Georgian allies to restore Byzantium. In the depths of Asia Minor, ruler of Rum Kaykhusraw I, who was adopted by Alexios III Angelos, could reclaim his adoptive father’s rights. Under the Latins reigns Theodore Branas, grandnephew of Manuel I Komnenos, and the Hungarians have Isaac II Angelos' son John...;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_GHURID;* Mu’izz’s One Thousand Sons ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_GHURID_DESC;The Ghorids is in turmoil. As if fulfilling the will of Mu'izz ad-Din, who regarded his thousand slaves as heirs, the Turkic nobility have proclaimed Mu'izz's trusted commander Aibak as Delhi Sultan. Mu'izz's other 'sons' - Qabacha and Iltutmish, married to Aibak's daughters, as well as Shiran, the son of the Bengal conqueror, have come under the new Sultan's rule. However, everyone haven't recognised Aibak. Ghazni proclaimed Mu'izz's slave Yildiz as ruler, while the Iranian nobility recognise only Mahmud and Jalal, the son and nephew of Ghiyath ad-Din. Will Aibak be able to restore the former imperial borders and will his family be able to retain the crown when other Mu'izz's slaves, primarily Iltutmish, grow their power? Or will the genuine Gurids lead the empire? And who knows, the turmoil among the Muslims would give the descendants of the noble Indian families a chance to regain their position? Someone must take the initiative, as the Mongol hordes are closing in....;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_SOUTHERN_INDIA;* The Southern Indian Campaign ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_SOUTHERN_INDIA_DESC;Kulottunga I ascended to Chola's throne. Since he was not a direct descendant of Chola rulers, the enemies of the empire decided to take advantage of the anarchy: in Sri Lanka with renewed vigour ignited Sinhalese rebellion, led by a descendant of the rulers of the island - Vijayabuhu, and Pandya, supported by Chera, preparing to gain independence. In the camp of Chola's old rival, the Western Chalukya, it is equally turbulent: ambitious Vikramaditya VI is endeavouring to overthrow his brother Someswara II and lead the empire. In this effort, he has enlisted the support of his younger brother Jayasimha, as well as Hoysala, Pandya, Hangal Kadamba and Seuna, while Someswara is ready to be supported by Goa Kadamba and Chola ruler Kulottunga. Vikramaditya, on the other hand, along with the rulers of Katanga (East Ganga, Nagavamsi and Somavamsi) are trying to mix the cards of Kulottunga in Vengri and help Vijayaditya III to retain the possession. Who will emerge victorious?;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_BATTLE_OF_TARAIN;* The Battle of Tarain ;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BM_BATTLE_OF_TARAIN_DESC;According to historical sources, Mu'izz ad-Din, the conqueror of India, sent an envoy to the court of Chauhan ruler Prithviraj III with a request or demand (it depends on interpretations) to resolve their differences peacefully: Prithviraj becomes a vassal of the Gurids and embraces Islam. The ruler of Chauhan rejected the demands. Then Mu'izz ad-Din together with Aibak gathered an army and marched on Chauhan, Prithviraj also gathered his forces and repulsed the Gurids in the battle of Tarain. But will 'the whole of the Ranas of Hind' be able to reproduce his success? Will Chauhan's neighbours - Chandela, Solanki, Paramara, with whom Prithviraj had fought, and also Gahadawala, the daughter of whose ruler he had kidnapped - continue to watch the destruction of the Hindu state, or will they forget old grievances and fight? The fate of North India will be decided in a new battle of Tarain!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_THE_ONLY_ABLE;* The Only Able;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_THE_ONLY_ABLE_DESC;For the second time in history, a woman led a Muslim state! She is Razia, ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. It is rumoured that her father Iltutmish admired his daughter's administrative talent so much that he even intended to make her the heir, because in his eyes Razia was the only capable to rule the empire. However, because of the opposition of the Turkic nobility Iltutmish was forced to abandon the idea. But using intrigue and popular support, Razia took the throne and began to rely on non-Turkic nobles. The Turkic nobility is already indignant and is preparing a new coup... And in Eastern India, tormented by the Bengal governor, Eastern Ganga's ruler Naransinha Deva I decides on a bold act: entering into an alliance with his brother-in-law from Haihaya, he is going not only to attack the governor's possessions, but also to reclaim part of Hindu territories. Accomplishing such a feat, he will be the only able to do so!;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_MANDATE_OF_HEAVEN;* Pretender for Mandate of Heaven;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_MANDATE_OF_HEAVEN_DESC;The Delhi Sultanate was at the height of its power. Muhammad ibn Tughlaq, while still a crown prince, demonstrated his military prowess when he led the destruction of Kakatiya. Now the ambitious ruler has turned his eyes northwards: he wants to conquer the declining Ulus Chagatai and Ilkhanate, and possibly claim the Mandate of Heaven for himself and his descendants. To this end, he poaches the courtiers of the Mongol states and assembles a large army... However, his own empire is in trouble. In Gujarat, having defeated Muhammad's army, independence was won by Hammir Singh, a descendant of the ancient Guhila dynasty, and in the south, in the depths of the withering Hoysala, a new shield and sword of Hinduism - Harihara, the future founder of the Vijayanagara Empire, matures. Muhammad's subjects are not happy with his, to put it mildly, whimsical character. So, who will win?;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_PLANTAGENET_1;* Angevin Knot of Contradictions;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_PLANTAGENET_1_DESC;The Anarchy in England has ended by the victory of Count Henry of Anjou, son of Matilda. He held vast estates stretching from Northumbria to the Pyrenees, later called 'the Angevin Empire'. As he had promised, the previous king's son, William de Blois, retained his holdings. But Henry II has intention to spread his power. He makes an invasion of Wales, which the Welsh princes want to use to weaken 'King Owain of Wales'. He attacks Brittany and claims the county of Toulouse for his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. This is silently watched by King Louis VII of France, who has no way of getting an heir. He and Henry have a pact: Louis's daughter Margaret is betrothed to Henry, heir to the English throne. Outside the 'empire', too, it's turbulent. In Ireland, local lords are vying for the title of supreme king and are ready to call on a powerful neighbour, while in the north, Gael Somerled has seized the estates of Gudrod Crovan, grandson of Fergus of Galloway. ;;;;;;;;;x,,,
BM_QUEEN_OF_THE_MUSLIMS;* ‘Malikat al-Muslimin’;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
BM_QUEEN_OF_THE_MUSLIMS_DESC;Sultan As-Salih of the Ayyubid dynasty is dead! His position was taken by his widow, Shajar al-Durr, his qiyan slave-girl, who thus became the new female Muslim ruler. Having got rid of As-Salih's son, Al-Muazzam Turan Shah, Shajar, who relied on her husband's Mamluks and was forced to remarry one of their leaders, Aybek, became a full-fledged 'Malikat al-Muslimin' ('Queen of the Muslims'). However, upon learning of the death of the last Ayyubids, their Syrian relative, An-Nasir Yusuf, emir of Aleppo, didn't recognise a woman's authority and began a struggle for power. He was supported by the Abbasid caliph al-Musta'sim. There is also the son of Turan Shah who rules in the north and who can be used against Shajar. However, the situation in Egypt is complicated by the fact that King Louis 'the Saint' of France, who vowed to lay on himself the cross, at the head of the Seventh Crusade landed in the Nile Delta and is preparing for a decisive battle with the Saracens. ;;;;;;;;;x,,,
