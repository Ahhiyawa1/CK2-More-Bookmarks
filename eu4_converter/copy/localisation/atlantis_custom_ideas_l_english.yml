 atlantean_explorers_desc: "The sailors of Atlantis crossed countless seas and oceans in search of new snakes for colonization and trade, and even found our lost homeland - Europe. It is vital that we continue to fund and equip these research expeditions."
 atlantean_colonists: "Establish Colonies"

 atlantean_traders: "Expand Trade"
 atlantean_traders_desc: "We sail the seas not only for the sake of war and colonization, but also for the sake of trade. There is no wall that is high enough to stop a horse with a cart filled with gold - and that is why we need more gold."
 atlantean_natural_philosophy: "Expand Philosophical Schools"

Therefore, we must continue our Hellenization efforts."
